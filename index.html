            <h2>What is Marks Percentage?</h2>
            <p>Marks percentage is a performance metric that represents the proportion of marks a student has obtained relative to the total possible marks, expressed as a percentage out of 100. It provides a quick and clear understanding of a student's academic performance.</p>
            <p>The formula to calculate the marks percentage is:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage = (Marks Obtained / Total Marks) * 100
            </pre>
            <p>This formula helps convert numerical marks into a percentage, which is easier to interpret and compare.</p>

            <h2>Why is Marks Percentage Important?</h2>
            <p>Marks percentage plays a crucial role in many academic evaluations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>University Admissions:</strong> Many institutions require students to meet a specific percentage threshold for admissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Applications:</strong> Companies often look at the percentage to evaluate a candidate’s academic standing.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Assessment:</strong> Teachers and academic institutions use percentages to assess a student's academic progress over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How to Calculate Marks Percentage</h2>
            <p>Let’s break down the process of calculating marks percentage through simple examples.</p>

            <h3>1. Single Subject Percentage Calculation</h3>
            <p>If you want to calculate the percentage for a single subject, the formula is straightforward. Let’s assume you got 41 marks out of 60 in your mathematics test.</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage = (Marks Obtained / Total Marks) * 100
            </pre>
            <p>Example Calculation:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage = (41 / 60) * 100 = 68.33%
            </pre>

            <h3>2. Multiple Subjects Percentage Calculation</h3>
            <p>When you need to calculate the overall percentage across multiple subjects, follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add up the marks obtained in all subjects.</li>
                <li>Add up the total possible marks.</li>
                <li>Divide the total obtained marks by the total possible marks and multiply by 100.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example Calculation: Assume a student has the following marks in four subjects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject 1: 85 out of 100</li>
                <li>Subject 2: 75 out of 100</li>
                <li>Subject 3: 95 out of 100</li>
                <li>Subject 4: 80 out of 100</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total Marks Obtained:</p>
            <pre>
                85 + 75 + 95 + 80 = 335
            </pre>
            <p>Total Maximum Marks:</p>
            <pre>
                100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400
            </pre>
            <p>Now, calculate the percentage:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage = (335 / 400) * 100 = 83.75%
            </pre>

            <h2>How to Convert Fractions to Percentages?</h2>
            <p>If you have a fraction and need to convert it into a percentage, you can use the following approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Divide the numerator by the denominator.</li>
                <li>Multiply the result by 100.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, to convert <code>4/9</code> into a percentage:</p>
            <pre>
                (4 / 9) * 100 = 44.44%
            </pre>

            <h2>How to Calculate Percentage Increase and Decrease?</h2>
            <p>Understanding percentage increase and decrease is essential in various fields, including economics, pricing, and performance tracking.</p>

            <h3>Percentage Increase</h3>
            <p>To calculate the percentage increase, use this formula:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100
            </pre>
            <p>Example: If a product price increases from $50 to $60:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage Increase = ((60 - 50) / 50) * 100 = 20%
            </pre>

            <h3>Percentage Decrease</h3>
            <p>To calculate the percentage decrease, use this formula:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage Decrease = ((Old Value - New Value) / Old Value) * 100
            </pre>
            <p>Example: If a product price decreases from $60 to $50:</p>
            <pre>
                Percentage Decrease = ((60 - 50) / 60) * 100 = 16.67%
            </pre>
